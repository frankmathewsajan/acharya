# Issue Resolution Summary - September 13, 2025

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. TypeScript Error: Cannot find name 'supabase'

**Issue Location:** `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/EnhancedParentDashboard.tsx:125`

**Root Cause:** Remaining Supabase reference in the `checkAuth` function after migration to Django backend.

**Solution Applied:**
- Replaced Supabase authentication call with Django JWT authentication context
- Updated authentication flow to use `useAuth()` hook
- Maintained backward compatibility with mock user data for development

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Before (causing error)
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

// After (fixed)
const authUser = useAuth().user;
if (!authUser) { navigate("/auth"); return; }
```

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

### 2. Django Migration Dependency Error

**Error Message:**
```
django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: 
Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency users.0001_initial
```

**Root Cause:** Django admin migrations were applied before the custom user model migrations, creating a circular dependency conflict.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Database Reset:** Removed existing SQLite database
2. **Migration Reset:** Cleared all migration files except `__init__.py`
3. **Fresh Migration Generation:** Created new migrations with proper dependency order
4. **Successful Migration Application:** Applied all migrations without conflicts
5. **Superuser Creation:** Created admin account for testing

**Commands Executed:**
```bash
# Reset database and migrations
rm db.sqlite3
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete

# Generate fresh migrations
uv run manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations successfully
uv run manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
uv run manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Migration Order Achieved:**
1. `contenttypes.0001_initial` ✅
2. `auth.0001_initial` ✅
3. `users.0001_initial` ✅ (Custom user model)
4. All other app migrations ✅
5. `admin.0001_initial` ✅ (Depends on user model)

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
