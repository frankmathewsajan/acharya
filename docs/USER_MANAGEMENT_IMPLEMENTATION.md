- Complete summary review
- Auto-generated email preview

### 3. Automatic User Account Creation ✅

**Backend Integration:**
- Creates both `User` and `StaffProfile` records automatically
- Auto-generates email: `role.employeeid@last5digits.rj.gov.in`
- Auto-generates password: `employeeid#last5digits`
- Validates unique email and employee ID

**Security Features:**
- Password must be changed on first login
- Automatic school association

### 4. Staff Credentials Management ✅

**Credentials Display Modal:**

### 5. Role-Based Staff Creation ✅

**Smart Defaults:**
- **Staff Tab**: Defaults to 'admin' role
- **Teachers Tab**: Defaults to 'faculty' role  
- **Librarians Tab**: Defaults to 'librarian' role
- **Wardens Tab**: Defaults to 'faculty' role (wardens are faculty with special duties)

**Context-Aware UI:**
- Dynamic help text based on selected tab
- Role descriptions explain purpose
- Unified workflow for all staff types

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components Modified
- `AdminDashboard.tsx`: Main user management interface
- Enhanced multi-step form with validation
- Credentials display modal with copy functionality
- Error handling and user feedback

### Backend Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/users/staff/`: Creates staff member and user account
- Automatic email and password generation
- School association and validation
- Comprehensive error handling

### Data Flow
1. Admin selects staff tab (teachers, librarians, wardens, or general staff)
2. Clicks "Add Staff" - role is pre-selected based on tab
3. Fills multi-step form with validation at each step
4. Backend creates both User and StaffProfile
5. Returns generated credentials to admin
6. Admin shares credentials with new staff member
