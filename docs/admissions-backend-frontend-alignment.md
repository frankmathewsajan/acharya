# Admissions Backend-Frontend Alignment Summary

## Issue Resolution Report
Date: December 28, 2024
Updated: September 17, 2025

### Issues Addressed

1. **Backend/Frontend Field Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: Backend model uses `decision` field but frontend was referencing `status` in many places
   - **Solution**: Updated all frontend references to use `decision` field consistently
   - **Files Changed**:
     - `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/AdminDashboard.tsx`
     - `frontend/src/services/adminAPI.ts`

2. **Accept/Reject Button Not Showing**
   - **Problem**: Button logic was checking `schoolDecision?.status` which was undefined
   - **Solution**: Updated button logic to check `schoolDecision?.decision`
   - **Result**: Accept/Reject buttons now display correctly for pending decisions

3. **Status Badge Empty**
   - **Problem**: Status badge was trying to read `schoolDecision.status` instead of `schoolDecision.decision`
   - **Solution**: Updated status badge rendering to use correct field
   - **Result**: Status badges now show "Accepted", "Rejected", or "Pending" correctly

4. **Document Display Issues**
   - **Problem**: Documents were showing full file paths instead of clean filenames
   - **Solution**: Updated document display logic to extract document number and filename only
   - **Result**: Clean document display showing "Document 1: filename.pdf" format

5. **Tracking Page Enhancement (NEW)**
   - **Problem**: Tracking was modal-based, showed incorrect status, had scrolling issues
   - **Solution**: Created dedicated /track page with enhanced functionality
   - **Result**: Professional tracking experience with fee payment integration

### Backend API Endpoints

1. **School Review Endpoint**: `/admissions/school-review/`
   - Method: GET
   - Returns: List of applications with school decisions
   - Fields: Uses `decision` field in SchoolAdmissionDecision objects

2. **School Decision Create**: `/admissions/school-decision/`
   - Method: POST
   - Parameters: `application_id`, `school_id`, `decision`, `notes`
   - Returns: Created decision object

3. **School Decision Update**: `/admissions/school-decision/{id}/`
   - Method: PATCH
   - Parameters: `decision`, `review_comments`

4. **Fee Payment Initialization**: `/admissions/fee-payment/init/` **(NEW)**
   - Method: POST
   - Parameters: `reference_id`, `school_decision_id` (optional)
   - Returns: Fee structure and payment information

### Frontend API Integration

- **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Uses correct `decision` field for all status checks and button logic
- **adminAPI.ts**: API calls use correct field names matching backend expectations
- **TrackingPage.tsx**: New dedicated page with fee payment integration
- **Type Definitions**: Updated to use `decision` field consistently

### Enhanced Features

- **Comprehensive fee breakdown** (tuition, library, lab, exam, admission fees)
- **Multiple payment methods** (online, card, bank transfer)
- **Payment modal interface** with clear pricing
- **Default fee structure creation** if none exists

### Data Flow Validation

1. Backend serializers include `school_decisions` in application responses
2. Frontend correctly parses and displays school decisions
3. Button states properly reflect current decision status
4. Status badges show correct text based on decision value
5. Document upload and display working correctly
6. **Fee payment flow** integrated with school selection
7. **Payment initialization** working with proper fee calculation

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test Accept/Reject button functionality for pending applications
2. Verify status badges display correctly for all decision states
3. Confirm document upload and display shows clean filenames
4. Test decision change functionality (Accept → Reject, Reject → Accept)
5. Verify school-specific filtering works correctly
6. **Test tracking page layout on different screen sizes**
7. **Test student choice workflow with multiple acceptances**
8. **Test fee payment initialization and modal display**
9. **Verify payment method selection and simulation**

### Configuration Notes

- Backend model: `SchoolAdmissionDecision.decision` (CharField with choices: pending, accepted, rejected)
- Frontend types: Updated to use `decision` field consistently
- API contracts: All endpoints now use `decision` field as expected
- **Fee Structure**: Default fees created automatically if none exist
- **Payment Methods**: Configurable list of supported payment options
