- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate interfaces for Students, Parents, Faculty, Admins, and Wardens
- **Document Management**: Secure file upload, validation, and serving with proper authentication
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Application status, enrollment updates, and notifications across the system

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.2+, Django REST Framework, JWT authentication, PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- **Development Tools**: UV package manager, npm, Git, VS Code
- **Production**: Ubuntu Linux, Nginx, Gunicorn, Let's Encrypt SSL, systemd services

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Read**: [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Understand system design and components
2. **Setup**: [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) - Follow development environment setup
3. **Build**: [API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md) - Integrate with backend APIs

### For System Administrators
1. **Plan**: [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) - Review system requirements and security considerations
2. **Deploy**: Follow production deployment instructions with proper security configuration
3. **Monitor**: Implement backup strategies and performance monitoring as outlined

### For Project Managers
1. **Overview**: [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Understand system capabilities and limitations
2. **Features**: Review core features and technical implementation details
3. **Planning**: [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) - Understand infrastructure and maintenance requirements

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Backend**: Django apps organized by domain (users, admissions, schools, academic modules)
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with services, hooks, and type definitions
- **Testing**: All test files located in `backend/test/` folder with organized test data and scripts
- **Documentation**: All documentation consolidated in `docs/` folder with three main documents

### Best Practices
- **Backend**: Use Django REST Framework serializers, ViewSets, and proper permission classes
- **Frontend**: TypeScript for type safety, React Query for API state management, shadcn/ui for components
- **Database**: Proper indexing, migration management, and data validation
- **Security**: Input validation, file upload restrictions, JWT token management, and CORS configuration

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Setup**: Follow development environment setup in Deployment Guide
2. **Feature Development**: Use proper Git branching and testing procedures
3. **Testing**: Use management commands and test scripts for validation
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation sections for new features
