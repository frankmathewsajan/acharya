# Access Denied Issue Fix

## Problem
Users with "Management" role were getting stuck on an "Access Denied" page with the message:
```
Access Denied
Your role (Management) is not recognized in the system.
```

There was no logout button, so users couldn't exit this screen.

## Root Cause
The `Dashboard.tsx` component had a role switch statement that only handled these roles:
- `student`
- `parent`
- `faculty`
- `warden`
- `admin`

The "Management" role was not included, so it fell through to the default case showing the access denied message.

## Solution

### 1. Added Support for "Management" Role
Updated the role switch statement in `Dashboard.tsx` to handle "Management" role:

```tsx
// Before
switch (user.role) {
  case "admin":
    return <AdminDashboard />;
  // ...
}

// After  
switch (user.role?.toLowerCase()) {
  case "admin":
  case "management":  // Added this line
    return <AdminDashboard />;
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Added Logout Buttons
Added logout functionality to prevent users from getting stuck:

**In Dashboard.tsx:**
- Added logout button to the "role not recognized" error page
- Added "Go to Login" button for unauthenticated users
- Created reusable `LogoutButton` component

**In AuthContext.tsx:**
- Enhanced `ProtectedRoute` component with proper access denied page
- Added logout button to the fallback UI

### 3. Case-Insensitive Role Matching
Made role matching case-insensitive using `user.role?.toLowerCase()` to handle variations like:
- `Management`
- `management` 
- `MANAGEMENT`

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`**
   - Added Management role case
   - Added LogoutButton component
   - Improved access denied UI

2. **`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Enhanced ProtectedRoute with logout functionality
   - Better fallback UI for access denied

## Test Results

✅ Users with "Management" role now access AdminDashboard  
✅ Logout buttons available on all access denied screens  
✅ No more getting stuck without logout option  
✅ Case-insensitive role matching works  

## Test Credentials
```
Email: admin@02402.rj.gov.in
Password: admin02402
Role: Management (should now work)
```

The Management role users can now successfully access the Admin Dashboard and have logout options available if anything goes wrong.
