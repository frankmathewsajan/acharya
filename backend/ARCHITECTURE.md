Production-ready backend architecture using **Django (latest)** + **Django REST Framework** (DRF) that implements the role-based ERP features you described. Includes recommended apps, data-model sketches, API structure, auth & RBAC, background workers, deployment, monitoring, security and scaling notes — plus example endpoints and flow diagrams you can implement immediately.

# High-level overview

* **Backend framework**: Django 4.x/5.x + Django REST Framework (DRF).
* **Auth**: JSON Web Tokens (SimpleJWT) for API auth; refresh tokens, optional OAuth2 for SSO later.
* **DB**: PostgreSQL (primary).
* **Cache / Broker**: Redis for caching + Celery broker (or RabbitMQ if you prefer).
* **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3 / MinIO) for uploaded docs, with presigned URLs.
* **Asynchronous work**: Celery for email, receipts, report/PDF generation, analytics aggregation.
* **API docs**: drf-spectacular / Swagger / Redoc.
* **Containerization / Deploy**: Docker → Kubernetes or ECS; Nginx + Gunicorn/uvicorn.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for tests, lint, build, deploy.
* **Monitoring / Logging**: Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry for error tracking, ELK/EFK for logs.
* **Security**: RBAC, per-field encryption for sensitive PII, TLS, CSP, rate-limiting, WAF (Cloudflare / AWS WAF).
* **Backups & DR**: Periodic DB dumps, incremental WAL ship, object-storage versioning, test restore drills.

# API design & sample endpoints

Use DRF ViewSets + Routers. Version your API (e.g., `/api/v1/`).

Authentication:

* `POST /api/v1/auth/login/` -> returns access + refresh JWT
* `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh/`

Users:

* `GET /api/v1/users/me/`
* `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/` (profile edits)
* `POST /api/v1/users/` (admin create staff or bulk import)

Admissions:

* `POST /api/v1/admissions/apply/`
* `GET /api/v1/admissions/applications/{id}/`
* `PATCH /api/v1/admissions/applications/{id}/status/` (admin)

Students:

* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/dashboard/` (aggregated data)
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/attendance/`
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/exams/`

Staff:

* `POST /api/v1/staff/attendance/mark/` (faculty marks class attendance)
* `POST /api/v1/staff/exams/{exam_id}/marks/` (upload marks)
* `POST /api/v1/staff/materials/` (upload study materials)

Fees:

* `GET /api/v1/fees/invoices/?student=...`
* `POST /api/v1/fees/invoices/{id}/pay/` (dummy gateway)
* `GET /api/v1/fees/invoices/{id}/receipt/` (download PDF)

Hostel:

* `GET /api/v1/hostel/rooms/`
* `POST /api/v1/hostel/allocate/`
* `POST /api/v1/hostel/room-change-request/`

Library:

* `GET /api/v1/library/books/`
* `POST /api/v1/library/borrow/`

Notices:

* `GET /api/v1/notices/`
* `POST /api/v1/notices/` (admin)

Reports:

* `GET /api/v1/reports/admissions/?from=...&to=...` -> CSV/Excel/PDF
* `POST /api/v1/reports/generate/` -> async job returns job id, then `GET /api/v1/reports/{job_id}/status/`

# RBAC & permissions

* Use Django's Groups + custom `Role` enum on `User`.
* Implement DRF `Permission` classes:

  * `IsStudent`, `IsParentOfStudent`, `IsFaculty`, `IsAdminStaff`, `IsWarden`, `HasPermission('fees.view_invoice')` (permission-based RBAC).
* Endpoint-specific checks (for e.g., parent can only view their children).

# Auth & security details

* Use **SimpleJWT** for token-based auth with rotating refresh tokens, blacklisting on logout.
* Password policies (length, complexity), account lockout on repeated failures.
* Two-factor auth optional (TOTP) for sensitive staff accounts.
* HTTPS mandatory. HSTS header.
* File uploads: validate content type & size, virus scanning (clamAV) if possible.
* Encrypt sensitive DB columns (Django field encryption or HashiCorp Vault for keys).
* Audit logs for create/update/delete of critical objects (fees, marks, hostels).
* Rate limiting: per-user and per-IP (DRF throttles + nginx/rate-limiter).

# Background jobs & async

* Use Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ:

  * Tasks: send email/SMS, generate PDF/Excel receipts, nightly analytics aggregation, backup triggers, scheduled notifications (smart alerts).
* For long-running jobs, return a job id and poll status via endpoint.

# File storage & large uploads

* Use S3 with presigned upload URLs for direct-from-client uploads.
* Keep metadata (file path, uploader, original filename, checksum) in DB.
* Serve public assets via CDN.

# Pagination, filtering, ordering

* Use LimitOffset or CursorPagination.
* Use DjangoFilterBackend for filtering (e.g., attendance by date range).
* Add search (Postgres full-text or Elasticsearch for heavy search needs).

# Caching & performance

* Cache frequently-read dashboard data in Redis with TTL, invalidate on relevant writes.
* Use DB indexes on FK fields, `admission_number`, `invoice_no`, `student` foreign keys, composite indexes for frequent queries (e.g., (student, date) on attendance).
* Use query optimization, select\_related / prefetch\_related in viewsets.

# Analytics & Bonus features

* Attendance/performance graphs: either compute on-demand (materialized views) or precompute nightly in Celery into summary tables.
* Smart alerts: Celery scheduled job checks rules (attendance% <75%) and enqueues notifications.
* Future ML features: export aggregates to a separate analytics DB (ClickHouse / BigQuery) if needed. Keep ML workflows separate (not in Django runtime).

# Reports & document generation

* Use WeasyPrint / xhtml2pdf / ReportLab to render PDFs from templates.
* Excel export: `openpyxl` / `pandas` to produce XLSX.
* Generate asynchronously; store resulting files on S3 and provide presigned download.

# Audit, testing & QA

* Unit tests (pytest + pytest-django), integration tests for major flows.
* Add contract tests for APIs.
* Add load tests (k6) before productionizing.
* CI pipeline: lint, test, build container, run migrations on staging, smoke tests, deploy.

# Deployment architecture (recommended)

Small-to-medium:

* Dockerized Django app behind Gunicorn (or Uvicorn if using ASGI features).
* Nginx reverse proxy / static file serving.
* Postgres (managed like RDS / Cloud SQL) with read replicas for scaling reads.
* Redis for cache + Celery broker; Celery workers horizontally scaled.
* S3 for files, CloudFront as CDN.

Enterprise:

* Kubernetes (GKE/EKS/AKS) with HPA, Persistent Volumes, Secrets manager.
* Separate pods for web, celery-worker, celery-beat, celery-flower (monitoring).
* Use ingress controller (nginx/contour) and cert-manager for TLS.

# Observability & SLA

* Metrics: Prometheus scraping Django app metrics (request latencies, DB query counts, Celery queue length).
* Traces: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing.
* Errors: Sentry alerting with configured escalation.
* Uptime: healthcheck endpoints `/healthz` and readiness/liveness for k8s.

# Backup & disaster recovery

* Daily DB backups + continuous WAL archiving.
* Test restore monthly.
* Object storage versioning or cross-region replication.
* Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) for reproducibility.

# Example request flows (sequence)

1. **Login & role-based redirect**

   * Client `POST /api/v1/auth/login/` -> returns JWT and `role`.
   * Client selects dashboard route: `/student/dashboard` or `/staff/dashboard`.
   * Backend: each dashboard route aggregates data from multiple services via viewsets or precomputed materialized views.

2. **Student admission -> seat allocation**

   * Student submits `POST /api/v1/admissions/apply/` with files uploaded to S3 presigned URL.
   * Celery job validates application & notifies admin.
   * Admin reviews `PATCH /api/v1/admissions/{id}/status/` -> if `approved`, allocate seat and create `StudentProfile`, send email & generate admission receipt (PDF via Celery).

3. **Faculty marks attendance**

   * Faculty `POST /api/v1/staff/attendance/mark/` with session + present\_students\[].
   * System creates `ClassSession` (if not exists), bulk-inserts `AttendanceRecord`.
   * Triggers: recalc attendance % for affected students (asynchronous), if <75% then enqueue notification.

4. **Fee payment & receipt**

   * Parent views invoice, clicks pay -> `POST /api/v1/fees/invoices/{id}/pay/` (dummy gateway returns success).
   * On success: create `Payment`, generate receipt with Celery, mark invoice paid, notify parent/student.

# API documentation & developer UX

* Host OpenAPI docs at `/api/docs/` (Swagger UI + ReDoc).
* Provide Postman / OpenAPI spec for frontend / mobile team.
* Add a developer sandbox with seed data (demo students, fees, hostel slots).

# Database sizing & scaling guidance

* Start with single PostgreSQL instance; use read replicas when read-heavy (dashboard queries).
* If analytics grows heavy, export event streams to data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, ClickHouse).
* Index hot paths: attendance reads, invoice lookups, student profile queries.

# Practical tech stack & libs (quick list)

* Django, djangorestframework, drf-spectacular
* djangorestframework-simplejwt
* django-storages\[boto3]
* celery, django-celery-beat, django-celery-results
* redis, psycopg2-binary
* weasyprint / reportlab / openpyxl
* django-environ for config, python-decouple
* Sentry SDK, prometheus-client
* pytest, factory-boy
* django-filter

# Security & compliance checklist (PII sensitive)

* Encrypt PII in DB or limit retention, role-based access to PII.
* Hash personally-identifying IDs in logs.
* Regular penetration testing.
* GDPR-like controls (right to delete/export data) — helpful for legal/regulatory compliance.
* Maintain consent record for communications.

# Minimal MVP roadmap (3–6 sprints)

1. Sprint 1: Core users, auth, profile, student dashboard, admissions form, file uploads.
2. Sprint 2: Fees (invoice, dummy payment, receipts), basic attendance marking, notices.
3. Sprint 3: Exams and marks upload, parent role read-only, staff role actions, hostel basic allocation.
4. Sprint 4: Reports (PDF), analytics basic graphs, notifications (email/in-app).
5. Sprint 5: Hardening: tests, CI, deployment to staging, monitoring, security reviews.
