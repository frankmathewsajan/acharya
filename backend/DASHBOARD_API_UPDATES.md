# School Management Dashboard - Backend API Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement dynamic school-specific data for the Admin Dashboard, replacing all mock/hardcoded data with real backend API calls.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logout Error - RefreshToken Blacklist
**Problem**: `'RefreshToken' object has no attribute 'blacklist'` error when logging out.

**Solution**: 
- Added `rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`
- Applied JWT blacklist migrations to create necessary database tables
- This enables proper token blacklisting on logout for security

### 2. Admin Dashboard Showing N/A Data
**Problem**: Dashboard showed "N/A" for all school data instead of real information for logged-in admin.

**Solution**: Created school-specific API endpoints that filter data based on the admin user's assigned school.

## New API Endpoints

### Schools API (`/api/v1/schools/`)

#### 1. School Statistics Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/schools/stats/
```

**Purpose**: Get comprehensive statistics for the logged-in admin's school.

**Authentication**: Required (Management role only)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "totalStudents": 5,
  "totalTeachers": 3,
  "totalStaff": 2,
  "totalWardens": 0,
  "activeParents": 0,
  "totalClasses": 3,
  "currentSemester": "Academic Session 2024-25",
  "school": {
    "name": "Test School 02402",
    "code": "RJ02402",
    "email": "admin@02402.rj.gov.in",
    "phone": "+91-9876543210",
    "address": "Test School Address, Test Village"
  }
}
```

#### 2. School Dashboard Data Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/schools/dashboard/
```

**Purpose**: Get all dashboard data (students, teachers, staff, users) for the logged-in admin's school.

**Authentication**: Required (Management role only)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "admission_number": "10001",
      "user": {
        "first_name": "Student",
        "last_name": "User 01",
        "email": "student01@02402.rj.gov.in"
      },
      "course": "Class 10",
      "batch": 1,
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "teachers": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "user": {
        "first_name": "Teacher",
        "last_name": "User 01",
        "email": "teacher01@02402.rj.gov.in"
      },
      "department": "Not specified",
      "designation": "Teacher",
      "experience_years": 0,
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "staff": [...],
  "users": [...],
  "fees": [],
  "attendance": [],
  "exams": []
}
```

## Backend Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`schools/urls.py`** (NEW)
   - Router configuration for school endpoints
   - Statistics and dashboard endpoints

2. **`schools/views.py`** (UPDATED)
   - `SchoolViewSet`: Read-only viewset for school data
   - `SchoolStatsAPIView`: School-specific statistics
   - `SchoolDashboardAPIView`: Comprehensive dashboard data

3. **`schools/serializers.py`** (NEW)
   - `SchoolSerializer`: School model serialization
   - `SchoolStatsSerializer`: Statistics response format

4. **`config/urls.py`** (UPDATED)
   - Added schools URL routing: `path('api/v1/schools/', include('schools.urls'))`

5. **`config/settings.py`** (UPDATED)
   - Added `rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist` to INSTALLED_APPS

### Data Models Used

- **`users.User`**: Main user model with school foreign key
- **`users.StudentProfile`**: Extended student information
- **`schools.School`**: School information and metadata

### Security & Access Control

- All endpoints require authentication
- School-specific data filtering based on `request.user.school`
- Management role verification for admin access
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Frontend Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/services/adminAPI.ts`** (UPDATED)
   - Updated `getSchoolStats()` to use `/api/v1/schools/stats/`
   - Updated all data fetching functions to use `/api/v1/schools/dashboard/`
   - Added proper error handling with fallback values

2. **`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/AdminDashboard.tsx`** (UPDATED)
   - Removed all mock/hardcoded data
   - Implemented real-time data loading from backend APIs
   - Added loading and error states
   - Dynamic user management based on school data

### Key Frontend Changes

- **Real Data Loading**: All dashboard sections now fetch data from backend
- **School-Specific Information**: Dashboard shows data only for logged-in admin's school
- **Dynamic User Management**: User list populated from backend API
- **Proper Error Handling**: Loading states and error messages
- **No Mock Data**: Completely removed hardcoded/mock data

## Test Data

### Admin Credentials
```
Email: admin@02402.rj.gov.in
Username: admin02402
Password: admin02402
School: Test School 02402 (RJ02402)
```

### Test Data Created
- **Students**: 5 test students (student01@02402.rj.gov.in to student05@02402.rj.gov.in)
- **Teachers**: 3 test teachers (teacher01@02402.rj.gov.in to teacher03@02402.rj.gov.in)
- **Staff**: 2 test staff members (staff01@02402.rj.gov.in to staff02@02402.rj.gov.in)

## Testing

### Backend API Testing
```bash
# Test school stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/schools/stats/

# Test dashboard data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/schools/dashboard/
```

### Database Verification
```python
# In Django shell
from users.models import User, StudentProfile
from schools.models import School

admin = User.objects.get(email='admin@02402.rj.gov.in')
school = admin.school
students = StudentProfile.objects.filter(school=school, is_active=True).count()
# Should return 5
```

## Results

✅ **Fixed logout error** - JWT token blacklisting now works correctly  
✅ **School-specific data** - Dashboard shows real data for admin's school  
✅ **Dynamic user management** - User list populated from backend  
✅ **No mock data** - All hardcoded data removed  
✅ **Proper API structure** - RESTful endpoints with proper authentication  
✅ **Test data available** - Full test school with students, teachers, staff  

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Endpoints**: Create APIs for fees, attendance, and exams data
2. **Data Validation**: Add input validation and data sanitization
3. **Performance**: Add caching and pagination for large datasets
4. **Real Schools**: Import actual school data from government sources
5. **Advanced Features**: Add filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
