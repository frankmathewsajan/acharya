# Admin Detail View Fix - Removed Static School Decisions Display

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The admin detail view was showing a static "School Decisions" section that always displayed "Pending" for all schools, regardless of the actual database status.

**Root Cause**: There was an old `get_enrollment_summary()` method in the admin fieldsets that was displaying static, non-updating information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Static Display Method
- Removed `get_enrollment_summary()` method from `AdmissionApplicationAdmin`
- Removed `'get_enrollment_summary'` from `readonly_fields`
- Removed the entire `('Enrollment Status', {'fields': ('get_enrollment_summary',)})` fieldset

### 2. Kept Dynamic Inline Display
- The `SchoolAdmissionDecisionInline` remains active
- This shows real-time, accurate data from the database
- Updates automatically when decisions change

## Result ‚úÖ

**Before**: Admin showed static "Pending" for all schools
```
School Decisions
G.P.S. DHOLAMAND KHEDA - Preference: 1st - Pending
G.G.U.P.S. FATEHGARH - Preference: 2nd - Pending  
G.SR.SEC.SCHOOL POLICE LINE - Preference: 3rd - Pending
```

**After**: Admin shows actual database status via inline
```
School admission decisions (inline table):
G.SR.SEC.SCHOOL POLICE LINE | 1st | ACCEPTED | ‚úÖ ENROLLED (09/17/25)
G.G.U.P.S. FATEHGARH | 2nd | ACCEPTED | ‚ùå WITHDRAWN (09/17/25)
G.P.S. DHOLAMAND KHEDA | 3rd | PENDING | ‚è≥ PENDING REVIEW
```

## Technical Details

### Removed Code:
```python
# OLD - Static display (removed)
def get_enrollment_summary(self, obj):
    # This was showing static "Pending" status
    
readonly_fields = [..., 'get_enrollment_summary']  # Removed

fieldsets = [
    # Removed this entire fieldset:
    ('Enrollment Status', {
        'fields': ('get_enrollment_summary',)
    })
]
```

### Active Code:
```python
# NEW - Dynamic inline display (kept)
class SchoolAdmissionDecisionInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = SchoolAdmissionDecision
    fields = ['school', 'preference_order', 'decision', 'get_status_display', ...]
    
    def get_status_display(self, obj):
        # Shows real-time status from database
        
class AdmissionApplicationAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [SchoolAdmissionDecisionInline]  # This provides real data
```

**The admin detail view will now show accurate, real-time school decision statuses that update according to the actual database!** üéâ
